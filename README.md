# SpaceXLaunchTimeline

> This demo application views a timeline of all launches by SpaceX. Inspiration for app is this video - [Using Vue.js, Vuetify, and the SpaceX API to Create a Rocket Launch Timeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2495FkOYTFQ). This app is created using **Angular 10** . Instead of using [Vuetify Timeline](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/timelines/#small) here used a cutsom  timeline component.
